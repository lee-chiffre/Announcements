Weekly blockchain backups
Node2.0 was offline for a few hours this week to do a full blockchain backup from genesis block. I am backing up the blockchain weekly at a random time. Each backup going forward should not take more than 15 minutes of downtime a week. Backup drive is kept with the "doomsday node" in a waterproof fireproof EMP proof case.

Electrumx server coming very soon
I found out how to build electrumx and the dependency tree from source. It is now installed on Node2.0 but not yet active. I am configuring electrumx this weekend and will start the sync. When the electrumx sync is completed I will post another announcement.

"Doomsday Node"
Description- Coming soon. This is a dedicated offline laptop with a drive of a weekly full blockchain backup stored in a fireproof waterproof and EMP proof case. To continue bitcoin operations if there is a global disaster.

Node03 will be set up after I start writing the-node-operators-manual. Node03 will be a test of my documentation and will run along side Node2.0
