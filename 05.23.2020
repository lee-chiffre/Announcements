ElectrumX server is finally installed on Node2.0. 
The dealay was that I was trying to figure out how to install it in a way that is compliant with my security standards. 
One of these is that all software should be compiled from source code.
I found a way to build the electrumx dependency tree. I'd rather take my time and learn what I am doing and do things the right way
and the secure way instead of rushing and do it insecurely or improperly. I am starting to get the hang of python now.
It took a while, but I stick to my word. I said I was going to eventually migrate to Node2.0 then host an Electrum service on it.

It is syncing right now and will serve up connections when the electrum sync is complete. ETA is 3-4 days. Just in time for halvening celebration.
It is the same as Node2.0 bitcoin node v3 onion address. V3 is more security than v2. 
The ONLY reason I run a v2 is because the bitcoin network needs v2 onion address for compatibility. 
When the bitcoin netwwork no longer requies v2 onion I will halt the shorter onion address and use strictly the v3 onion address.

Node2.0 Electrum address.

If there is demand to run it on a v2 address also I might do so if requested.

Electrumx is unreasonable. I have synced a total of 8 days and had to pause it. I have been trying to sync again and estimated time is 30-40 days. 
Almost 2 months to sync is just not reasonable. I am thinking about cancelling the public electrumx service and instead focus on a private electrum 
personal server to test with and will include in my guide I am piecing together.

In my opinion Wasabi wallet is the best lightweight wallet for privacy and this is what I am promoting because of the privacy. Wasabi can be pointed
to a full node without privacy leaks. If you want to see what full nodes I run you can see the server list here 
https://github.com/lee-chiffre/server-list and with Wasabi you can also run your own local full node. But wasabi does not have much needed features 
that Electrum has, like multisig. But the problem with electrum is privacy. The electrum server has the ability to see all the bitcoin addresses 
that are related to each other. The best way to use electrum is with a server you trust or better is to run your own server.

In my node setup guide I will explain how to set up a electrum personal srever if I go this option.
