ElectrumX server is finally installed on Node2.0. 
The dealay was that I was trying to figure out how to install it in a way that is compliant with my security standards. 
One of these is that all software should be compiled from source code.
I found a way to build the electrumx dependency tree. I'd rather take my time and learn what I am doing and do things the right way
and the secure way instead of rushing and do it insecurely or improperly. I am starting to get the hang of python now.
It took a while, but I stick to my word. I said I was going to eventually migrate to Node2.0 then host an Electrum service on it.

It is syncing right now and will serve up connections when the electrum sync is complete. ETA is 3-4 days. Just in time for halvening celebration.
It is the same as Node2.0 bitcoin node v3 onion address. V3 is more security than v2. 
The ONLY reason I run a v2 is because the bitcoin network needs v2 onion address for compatibility. 
When the bitcoin netwwork no longer requies v2 onion I will halt the shorter onion address and use strictly the v3 onion address.

Node2.0 Electrum address.

If there is demand to run it on a v2 address also I might do so if requested.
